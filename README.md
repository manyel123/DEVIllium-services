# DEVIllium-services
Microservice for contact forms, dev publications and messages between users.

This service was created using Spring-boot framework. This service allows the creation, saving and consulting of three main services, Contact form service, publications service and messages service.

DEVIllium services were designed to be independent, so they can be easily separated if you are familiar with MVC. Here they were merged into one project to avoid using multiple repositories.
